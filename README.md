## Project Description

For our second General Assembly project, we are creating RESTful CRUD applications that have the ability to let a user create, read, update and delete data in an application. I am planning to create a an application that will serve a mutual aid network by creating a request system, that functionally works like an alert board. This app aims to bridge the connection between mutual aid volunteers and those in need of assistance by allowing an alternative to disenfranchising carceral agents to respond to alerts concerning emergencies, suspected drug overdoses, mental health crises and requests for other help in the form of resources. For the minimum viable product within the timeframe allotted for this project, the app will include the ability for users to view post, edit and delete various types of alerts, as well as browse links to resources for both users and volunteers. For the post-MVP, the app will have the ability to create verified and unverified volunteer profiles and potentially a forum where these profiles could interact and share information.

## User Stories

As a user of this app, I can either be requesting assistance or responding to requests. 

If users are witnessing an emergency, suspected overdose, a mental health crisis, need to connect someone with resources or experiencing any of these circumstances as the user, users could submit a request that will be immediately posted to the alert board. 

Users can provide optional contact or location information as well as a description depending on the situation and its urgency. 

After submitting requests,  requests will display as alerts on the app in sequential order and will have the functionality of being updated and deleted once posted. 

Users who are responding to requests can view the alerts posted and choose to respond and act in assistance based on the information provided.

Visitors to the site may also access a menu that will provide links to external organizations providing various resources and training.

In the post-MVP application, users would be able to register profiles as unverified or verified volunteers and have access to a forum. Also could implement functionality that marks request as pending or indicates that someone is on the way and tending to the situation and other volunteers could contact others who are assisting the request and join.
